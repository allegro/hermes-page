                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_0">Sound foundations</h2>
                    <p>Hermes builds on widely adopted OpenSource tools - Kafka and Zookeeper.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_1">Reliable</h2>
                    <p>We have been using Hermes in production for mission-critical messaging for 6+ months, processing billions of events and solving many corner-cases. We are constantly monitored by our users looking for 100% delivered events.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_2">Stable response time</h2>
                    <p>Ever needed strict SLA for published events? Hermes takes care of any Kafka hiccups and can guarantee maximum response time for 99th percentile of published events.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_3">Fault tolerant</h2>
                    <p>Network partitioning? Kafka having trouble? Hermes can endure it, staying responsive to clients and sending events to Kafka when problems are over.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_4">Low overhead</h2>
                    <p>Hermes is just a thin wrapper over Kafka - we manage to make lives of developers easier at low cost.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_5">Easy to use</h2>
                    <p>It takes HTTP client to become a publisher and HTTP endpoint to become a subscriber - it can't get any easier then that.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_6">We care about subscribers</h2>
                    <p>Changing pull to push model, we created algorithms that adapt sending speed to subscribers current capabilities.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_7">No longer a black box</h2>
                    <p>We gather a lot of metrics that can be sent to Graphite - track each topic and subscription rate, latency, Kafka lag. We also provide tools that allow for tracking state of each event on chosen topic/subscriptions when closer look is needed.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_8">Easy to manage</h2>
                    <p>We created GUI to manage Hermes (and Kafka) topics and subscriptions. API simplifies common operations like repeating already received events - just give us a timestamp and we will find relevant events on all partitions.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_9">Easily extensible</h2>
                    <p>Hermes components can be used as libraries, with programmatic API that can be easily extended and customized. You can register own callbacks, apply authorization and many more.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 id="toc_10">Easy to get started with</h2>
                    <p>Thanks to Docker magic, you are able to run Hermes on your localhost in minutes - check out our <a href="http://hermes-pubsub.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contents/tutorials/01_getting_started.html">getting started guide</a> for more.</p>
